	    <h1>About My Bachelor Life</h1>

	    <p>
	    	The journey was started in 2015, at that time I was 18 years old. I exactly remembered that first day of the college, when I met few people who became a most important part of my life in present. We have a gang of four girls. We had a great quality time together and have a memorable and precious memory.

	    	Each year our college was organized a technical festival, which improves our lots of skills. I actively participated most of the events and also during third and fourth year I organized events, in which students got more knowledge with fun.I also won many times in few events and got certificates and medals for that. I also got "Dewang Mehta IT award" by Gujarat Technological University for my acadamic grades. I also registered myself for three award from my college for top ranker.

	    	It was a journey towards discovering my area of interest.It taught me how to rise up when I failed. It was the time when I got an opportunity to work on the different and interesting projects which enhance my knowledge a lot. It were a really tricky but it never boared me. I love that precious four years of my life which taught me a very helpfull and memorable lessons which I never forgot.
